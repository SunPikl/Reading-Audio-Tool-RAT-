# Reading-Audio-Tool-RAT-
Reformats a webpage through background/text color, font style, and font size.


A simple extension created during my first Hackathon that allows a webpage to be reformatted to make webpages to be easily read. Created with the intention of making webpages easily accessable to those with troubles reading small font, specific font styles, or those with colorblindness, this extension can be used on many webpages to change font size, font color, background color, and font style.
